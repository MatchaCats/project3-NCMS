In our data visualization project, we recognized the critical importance of data privacy and anonymity, especially when handling sensitive information such as mental health status. To avoid the risk of revealing personally identifiable information, we ensured that all visualizations presented aggregated data rather than show individual responses. All participants in the dataset were referred to only by created ID numbers, which further protected their identities and helped prevent any potential stigmatization that might arise from misinterpreting specific data points. By anonymizing the data in this way, we aimed to foster a respectful and ethical environment for discussing the implications of technology usage on mental health. The data was collected through self-reported surveys, highlighting the importance of considering the subjective nature of the responses in our analysis.

Additionally, we committed to maintaining the accuracy and integrity of our analysis. We verified that the dataset sourced from Kaggle was reliable and up-to-date, as misrepresentation could lead to harmful conclusions. Our visualizations were grounded in contextual integrity, providing viewers with a clear understanding of the dataâ€™s origins. By transparently communicating our methodology and findings, we aimed to build trust with our audience and ensure that our visualizations served as a responsible exploration of the relationship between technology usage and mental health indicators.
